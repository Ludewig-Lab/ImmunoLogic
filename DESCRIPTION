Description: Provides a suite of tools focused on the analysis and
    visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data from the 'Seurat'
    package. Key features include an interactive 'Shiny' application for
    exploring 'Seurat' objects ('SingleCellBrowserSeurat3') and a
    function for generating complex average expression heatmaps with
    statistical significance ('avgHeatmap'). The package also offers
    advanced statistical modeling capabilities, including functions to
    fit ('fit_mmlt_flexible') and diagnose ('plot_gof') flexible
    multivariate maximum likelihood transformation (MMLT) models via the
    'tram' package. Additional utilities support creating detailed
    correlation matrices and formatting p-values for publication.
